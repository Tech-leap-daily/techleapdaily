            <h2>üöÄ The Tweet That Started It All</h2>
            <p>Picture this: You're scrolling through Twitter on a regular Tuesday when suddenly, the entire tech world explodes over one name‚Äî<strong>Soham Parekh</strong>. A Mumbai-based software engineer who just pulled off what might be the most audacious employment stunt in Silicon Valley history.</p>
            
            <p>It all started when Playground AI founder Suhail Doshi dropped a bombshell tweet that would rack up 25,000 likes and send shockwaves through the startup ecosystem:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                <em>"PSA: there's a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He's been preying on YC companies and more. Beware."</em>
            </div>

            <h2>üé≠ The Master of Multiple Identities</h2>
            <p>What unfolded next was straight out of a tech thriller. <strong>At least 10 tech company executives</strong> came forward, revealing they had all recently employed the same person. The same Soham Parekh who had somehow managed to:</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>‚è∞ The 140-Hour Work Week Confession</h2>
            <p>In a rare interview on the daily tech show TBPN, Parekh broke his silence with a confession that was equal parts shocking and sympathetic:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                <em>"I'm not proud of what I've done. That's not something I endorse either. But no one really likes to work 140 hours a week, I had to do it out of necessity."</em>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>140 hours a week.</strong> Let that sink in. That's working 20 hours a day, 7 days a week. While most people struggle to balance one demanding job, Parekh was essentially living four parallel professional lives.
            </div>

            <h2>ü¶∏ From Villain to Folk Hero</h2>
            <p>Here's where the story gets fascinating. What started as a cautionary tale about employment fraud quickly transformed into something unexpected. The internet didn't just condemn Parekh‚Äîmany began to celebrate him.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because in an era of:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>Mass tech layoffs</li>
                <li>Hustle culture toxicity</li>
                <li>Companies demanding "rockstar" employees while offering minimal job security</li>
                <li>The rise of remote work blurring traditional employment boundaries</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Parekh became an accidental symbol of workers fighting back against a system that many feel has become increasingly exploitative.</p>

            <h2>üéØ The Skills That Made It Possible</h2>
            <p>According to hiring managers and engineers who worked with him, Parekh wasn't just lucky‚Äîhe was <strong>exceptionally skilled</strong>. One Hacker News commenter noted: <em>"He will blow the interviews completely out of the water. Easily top 1% or top 0.1% of candidates."</em></p>
            
            <p>This raises uncomfortable questions for the tech industry:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>How did multiple sophisticated hiring processes fail to detect this?</li>
                <li>What does it say about remote work oversight?</li>
                <li>Are companies so desperate for talent that they skip basic verification?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üëª The Vanishing Act</h2>
            <p>Just when the story couldn't get more bizarre, Parekh announced his "newest employer"‚ÄîDarwin Studios, an AI video remixing startup‚Äîclaiming this time he'd work exclusively. But within hours, both his post and the CEO's announcement mysteriously disappeared, leaving the tech world with more questions than answers.</p>

            <h2>üîç The Bigger Picture</h2>
            <p>Parekh's story isn't just about one person gaming the system. It's a mirror reflecting deeper issues in modern work culture:</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>üåü Cultural Phenomenon</h2>
            <p>Within days, Parekh achieved something few people ever do‚Äîhe became a <strong>cult hero</strong> and cautionary tale simultaneously. Tech Twitter was divided between those calling him a scammer and others hailing him as a genius who exposed Silicon Valley's broken hiring practices.</p>

            <h2>üìä The Aftermath</h2>
            <p>As the dust settles, Parekh's saga has sparked industry-wide conversations about:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>Remote work policies and verification</li>
                <li>The ethics of "overemployment"</li>
                <li>Whether traditional employment models are outdated</li>
                <li>The pressure on workers to maximize income in an uncertain economy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚öñÔ∏è The Verdict</h2>
            <p>Love him or hate him, Soham Parekh just wrote himself into Silicon Valley folklore. He proved that with enough skill, audacity, and a 140-hour work week, one person can simultaneously be employed by multiple companies in the digital age.</p>
            
            <p>The real question isn't whether what he did was right or wrong‚Äîit's what his story reveals about the current state of work, trust, and survival in the modern economy.</p>

            <div class="cta">
                <h3>What's Your Take?</h3>
                <p><em>Is Soham Parekh a cautionary tale about employment fraud, or a folk hero who exposed Silicon Valley's broken system? The internet is still deciding.</em></p>
